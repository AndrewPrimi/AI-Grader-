  "answer": [
    "**Problem Overview:**",
    "This is a statics problem involving a human standing while holding a briefcase.",
    "The objective is to calculate:",
    "a) The distribution of foot forces (F₁, F₂) for a 10 kg briefcase.",
    "b) The maximum briefcase weight before tipping occurs.",
    "",
    "**Known Parameters:**",
    "- Total body mass: $M = 100\\,\\text{kg}$",
    "- Height: $H = 2\\,\\text{m}$",
    "- Briefcase mass: $m = 10\\,\\text{kg}$",
    "",
    "**Part A – Force Distribution:**",
    "Approach: Use moment equilibrium about the feet.",
    "The center of gravity (CG) of the man is at midline, while the briefcase creates asymmetry.",
    "",
    "Calculation for right foot (F₂):",
    "$F_2 = \\left( \\frac{0.191}{2} \\cdot 100 + \\left(0.129 + \\frac{0.191}{2}\\right) \\cdot 10 \\right) \\cdot \\frac{9.81}{0.191} = 605\\,\\text{N}$",
    "",
    "Then left foot (F₁):",
    "$F_1 = 110 \\cdot 9.81 - 605 = 474\\,\\text{N}$",
    "",
    "**Part B – Maximum Briefcase Mass Before Tipping:**",
    "Tipping occurs when $F_2 = 0$, i.e., all the weight is on the left foot.",
    "",
    "Stability condition:",
    "$\\frac{m \\cdot 0.129H}{M + m} \\leq \\frac{0.191H}{2}$",
    "",
    "Solving:",
    "- Rearranged equation: $m = \\frac{0.191}{2 \\cdot 0.129} (M + m)$",
    "- Substitute $M = 100$",
    "- Solving yields: $m = 2.85M = 285\\,\\text{kg}$",
    "",
    "**Conclusion:**",
    "Maximum briefcase mass before tipping: $m_{\\text{max}} = 285\\,\\text{kg}$"
