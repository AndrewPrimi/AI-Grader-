    "**Model Overview:**",
    "This is a Maxwell viscoelastic model composed of:",
    "- A spring ($E$)",
    "- A dashpot ($\\eta$)",
    "- Another spring ($E$)",
    "All in series configuration.",
    "",
    "**Initial Conditions:**",
    "- $\\sigma(t = 0) = \\sigma_0$",
    "- $\\varepsilon(t = 0) = \\varepsilon_0$",
    "",
    "**Constitutive Relations:**",
    "- Dashpot stress: $\\sigma_{\\text{dash}} = \\eta \\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dt}$",
    "- Spring stress: $\\sigma_{\\text{spring}} = E \\varepsilon$",
    "",
    "**Objective:**",
    "- Determine the strain response under constant stress.",
    "- Determine the stress response under constant strain.",
    "",
    "---",
    "**Case 1: Constant Stress ($\\sigma = c$)**",
    "- From the dashpot equation: $\\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dt} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\eta}$",
    "- Integrate to find strain:",
    "$\\varepsilon(t) = \\frac{\\sigma t}{\\eta} + \\varepsilon_0$",
    "",
    "**Note:**",
    "The Maxwell model does not resist deformation well under constant stress; strain grows linearly over time.",
    "",
    "---",
    "**Case 2: Constant Strain ($\\varepsilon = c$)**",
    "- Stress decays exponentially over time:",
    "$\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_1 E_2}{\\eta (E_1 + E_2)} t\\right)$",
    "",
    "**Conclusion:**",
    "This model captures basic creep and stress relaxation behavior, but has limitations for permanent deformation modeling."
