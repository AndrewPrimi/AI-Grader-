**Restated Question:**

A man is standing upright, holding a briefcase in one hand. The forces exerted by the ground on his feet are labeled as \( F_1 \) (left foot) and \( F_2 \) (right foot). How can you determine:
1. The distribution of forces (\( F_1 \) and \( F_2 \)) on the feet?
2. The maximum mass of the briefcase before the man tips over?

**Additional Information/Assumptions for Solving:**
- The man and briefcase are in static equilibrium (not accelerating or rotating).
- The total weight is distributed between the two feet.
- The briefcase is held on one side (let's assume the right hand, affecting the right foot more).
- The center of mass of the man is at a distance \( d_m \) from the left foot, and the briefcase is at a distance \( d_b \) from the left foot (further right).
- The distance between the feet (width of stance) is \( D \).
- Mass of the man: \( m_m \), mass of the briefcase: \( m_b \).
- Gravitational acceleration: \( g \).

**Free-Body Diagram and Equilibrium Conditions:**
- Vertical force equilibrium: \( F_1 + F_2 = m_m g + m_b g \)
- Rotational equilibrium (taking moments about the left foot):
  \[
  F_2 D = m_m g d_m + m_b g d_b
  \]
  (All distances are measured from the left foot.)

**Solving for Forces:**
1. \( F_2 = \frac{m_m g d_m + m_b g d_b}{D} \)
2. \( F_1 = m_m g + m_b g - F_2 \)

**Maximum Briefcase Mass Before Tipping:**
- Tipping occurs when \( F_1 = 0 \) (left foot just about to lift off).
- Set \( F_1 = 0 \):
  \[
  m_m g + m_b g = F_2 
  \]
  But from above, \( F_2 = m_m g + m_b g \) when \( F_1 = 0 \), so:
  \[
  m_m g + m_b g = \frac{m_m g d_m + m_b g d_b}{D}
  \]
  Solve for \( m_b \):
  \[
  (m_m + m_b) D = m_m d_m + m_b d_b
  \]
  \[
  m_m D + m_b D = m_m d_m + m_b d_b
  \]
  \[
  m_b (D - d_b) = m_m (d_m - D)
  \]
  \[
  m_b = \frac{m_m (d_m - D)}{D - d_b}
  \]
  (Note: \( d_b > D \) if the briefcase is outside the right foot, which is not typical. Usually, \( d_b < D \), so the denominator is positive.)

**Summary:**
- Use force and moment equilibrium to distribute forces on the feet.
- The maximum mass before tipping is found by setting the normal force on the left foot to zero and solving for \( m_b \).

**Equations for Solver Agent:**
- \( F_1 + F_2 = (m_m + m_b)g \)
- \( F_2 D = m_m g d_m + m_b g d_b \)
- \( F_1 = (m_m + m_b)g - F_2 \)
- \( m_b = \frac{m_m (d_m - D)}{D - d_b} \) (maximum before tipping)

You can now proceed to solve for specific values if the parameters are given.

# Solver

Let's start by making a step-by-step plan:

**Plan:**
1. Define all variables and draw the free-body diagram.
2. Write the equations for vertical force equilibrium and rotational equilibrium.
3. Solve for the forces on the feet (F₁ and F₂).
4. Determine the tipping condition (when F₁ = 0).
5. Solve for the maximum briefcase mass that can be held before tipping.

Let's proceed with Step 1:

**Step 1: Define variables and diagram**
- Let mₘ = mass of the man
- Let m_b = mass of the briefcase
- g = gravitational acceleration
- D = distance between the feet
- dₘ = horizontal distance from left foot to man’s center of mass
- d_b = horizontal distance from left foot to briefcase (held at right side)
- F₁ = normal force at left foot
- F₂ = normal force at right foot

The man is standing upright, holding the briefcase in his right hand. All forces act vertically. The briefcase shifts the center of mass to the right.

**Next step:** Write the equilibrium equations (Step 2).

# Solver

**Step 2: Write the Equilibrium Equations**

**Vertical Force Equilibrium:**
\[
F_1 + F_2 = (m_m + m_b)g
\]

**Rotational Equilibrium (taking moments about the left foot):**
- The moment arm for the man's weight is \(d_m\).
- The moment arm for the briefcase is \(d_b\).
- The moment arm for the right foot's reaction force is \(D\).

\[
F_2 \cdot D = m_m g d_m + m_b g d_b
\]

**Step 3: Solve for \(F_2\) and \(F_1\):**

\[
F_2 = \frac{m_m g d_m + m_b g d_b}{D}
\]
\[
F_1 = (m_m + m_b)g - F_2
\]

---

**Step 4: Tipping Condition**

Tipping occurs when \(F_1 = 0\):

\[
(m_m + m_b)g = F_2
\]
Plug in the value of \(F_2\) from above:
\[
(m_m + m_b)g = \frac{m_m g d_m + m_b g d_b}{D}
\]

---

**Step 5: Solve for the Maximum Briefcase Mass (\(m_b\)) Before Tipping**

\[
(m_m + m_b) D = m_m d_m + m_b d_b
\]
\[
m_m D + m_b D = m_m d_m + m_b d_b
\]
\[
m_b D - m_b d_b = m_m d_m - m_m D
\]
\[
m_b (D - d_b) = m_m (d_m - D)
\]
\[
m_b = \frac{m_m (d_m - D)}{D - d_b}
\]

---

If you have the numbers for \(m_m\), \(d_m\), \(D\), and \(d_b\), you can plug them in to get the maximum \(m_b\).

**Step 2: Write the Equilibrium Equations**

- **Vertical Force Equilibrium:**
  \[ F_1 + F_2 = (m_m + m_b)g \]

- **Rotational Equilibrium (moments about left foot):**

- \[ F_1 = (m_m + m_b)g - F_2 \]

Let's move to step 4: Determine the tipping condition (when F₁ = 0).

# Solver

**Step 4: Tipping Condition**

Tipping occurs when the normal force under the left foot vanishes (\(F_1 = 0\)), meaning all the weight is supported by the right foot. 

Set \(F_1 = 0\):

\[
(m_m + m_b)g = F_2
\]

From the moment equation:

\[
F_2 = \frac{m_m g d_m + m_b g d_b}{D}
\]

Combine the two equations:

\[
(m_m + m_b) g = \frac{m_m g d_m + m_b g d_b}{D}
\]

Divide both sides by \(g\):

\[
m_m + m_b = \frac{m_m d_m + m_b d_b}{D}
\]

Multiply both sides by \(D\):

\[
(m_m + m_b) D = m_m d_m + m_b d_b
\]

Rearrange to solve for \(m_b\):

\[
m_m D + m_b D = m_m d_m + m_b d_b
\]
\[
m_b D - m_b d_b = m_m d_m - m_m D
\]
\[
m_b (D - d_b) = m_m (d_m - D)
\]
\[
m_b = \frac{m_m (d_m - D)}{D - d_b}

**Final Answers:**

- **Force distribution:**
  \[
  F_2 = \frac{m_m g d_m + m_b g d_b}{D}
  \]
  \[
  F_1 = (m_m + m_b)g - F_2

# Solver

**Step 5: Solve for the Maximum Briefcase Mass (m_b) Before Tipping**

From the previous step, we have:

\[
m_b = \frac{m_m (d_m - D)}{D - d_b}
\]

This gives the maximum mass of the briefcase the man can hold before tipping occurs, assuming all distances are measured from the left foot and the briefcase is held at the right side.

**Question Restatement:**

A man is standing and holding a briefcase in one hand. The ground reaction forces on his feet are \(F_1\) (left foot) and \(F_2\) (right foot). We are to determine:
1. The distribution of forces (\(F_1\) and \(F_2\)) on the feet.
2. The maximum mass of the briefcase before the man will tip over.

**Assumptions and Definitions:**
- Mass of man: \(m_m\)
- Mass of briefcase: \(m_b\)
- Gravity: \(g\)
- Distance between feet: \(D\)
- Distance from left foot to man's center of mass: \(d_m\)
- Distance from left foot to briefcase: \(d_b\)

**Step 1: Force and Moment Equilibrium**
- Vertical equilibrium: \(F_1 + F_2 = (m_m + m_b)g\)
- Rotational equilibrium (moments about left foot): \(F_2 D = m_m g d_m + m_b g d_b\)

**Step 2: Solve for Foot Forces**
\[
F_2 = \frac{m_m g d_m + m_b g d_b}{D}
\]
\[
F_1 = (m_m + m_b)g - F_2
\]

**Step 3: Tipping Condition**
Tipping occurs when \(F_1 = 0\):
\[
(m_m + m_b)g = F_2
\]
\[
(m_m + m_b)g = \frac{m_m g d_m + m_b g d_b}{D}
\]
\[
m_m + m_b = \frac{m_m d_m + m_b d_b}{D}
\]
\[
m_b = \frac{m_m (d_m - D)}{D - d_b}
\]

**Summary:**
- \(F_1 + F_2 = (m_m + m_b)g\)
- \(F_2 = \frac{m_m g d_m + m_b g d_b}{D}\)
- \(F_1 = (m_m + m_b)g - F_2\)
- Maximum briefcase mass before tipping: \(m_b = \frac{m_m (d_m - D)}{D - d_b}\)
