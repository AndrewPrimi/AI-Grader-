**Restated Question:**

We are given a viscoelastic model consisting of two Maxwell elements in parallel (each Maxwell element is a spring and dashpot in series). The parameters for the two branches are:
- Branch 1: Spring with modulus \(E_1\), dashpot with viscosity \(\eta_1\)
- Branch 2: Spring with modulus \(E_2\), dashpot with viscosity \(\eta_2\)

The constitutive equations are:
- For dashpot: \( \sigma_{dash} = \eta \frac{d\varepsilon}{dt} \)
- For spring: \( \sigma_{spring} = E \varepsilon \)

We are to analyze the response of this model to:
1. **Constant stress:** (Creep test) \( \sigma(t) = \sigma_0 \) for \( t \ge 0 \)
2. **Constant strain:** (Stress relaxation test) \( \varepsilon(t) = \varepsilon_0 \) for \( t \ge 0 \)

---

**Constitutive Equation for the Parallel Maxwell Model:**

For each Maxwell element (i = 1,2):
\[
\sigma_i + \tau_i \frac{d\sigma_i}{dt} = E_i \tau_i \frac{d\varepsilon}{dt}\ , \qquad \tau_i = \frac{\eta_i}{E_i}
\]

Total stress: \( \sigma(t) = \sigma_1(t) + \sigma_2(t) \)

---

**1. Response to Constant Stress (Creep):**
Given \( \sigma(t) = \sigma_0 \), find \( \varepsilon(t) \).

The solution for strain under constant stress for each Maxwell branch is:
\[
\varepsilon_i(t) = \frac{\sigma_0}{E_i} \left(1 + \frac{t}{\tau_i} \right)
\]
Total strain:
\[
\varepsilon(t) = \varepsilon_1(t) + \varepsilon_2(t) = \frac{\sigma_0}{E_1} \left(1 + \frac{t}{\tau_1} \right) + \frac{\sigma_0}{E_2} \left(1 + \frac{t}{\tau_2} \right)
\]
Or, rearranged:
\[
\varepsilon(t) = \sigma_0 \left[ \left( \frac{1}{E_1} + \frac{1}{E_2} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{E_1 \tau_1} + \frac{1}{E_2 \tau_2} \right)t \right]
\]
But more generally, the strain grows linearly with time after an initial jump, characteristic of the parallel Maxwell model.

---

**2. Response to Constant Strain (Stress Relaxation):**
Given \( \varepsilon(t) = \varepsilon_0 \), find \( \sigma(t) \).

The stress in each Maxwell branch relaxes exponentially:
\[
\sigma_i(t) = E_i \varepsilon_0 \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\tau_i}\right)
\]
Total stress:
\[
\sigma(t) = \sigma_1(t) + \sigma_2(t) = E_1 \varepsilon_0 \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\tau_1}\right) + E_2 \varepsilon_0 \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\tau_2}\right)
\]
So the stress decays as a sum of two exponentials.

|------------------|---------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Creep (Constant Stress) | \(\sigma_0\)    | \(\varepsilon(t)\) | \( \varepsilon(t) = \frac{\sigma_0}{E_1}\left(1 + \frac{t}{\tau_1}\right) + \frac{\sigma_0}{E_2}\left(1 + \frac{t}{\tau_2}\right) \) |
| Relaxation (Constant Strain) | \(\varepsilon_0\) | \(\sigma(t)\)     | \( \sigma(t) = E_1 \varepsilon_0 \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\tau_1}\right) + E_2 \varepsilon_0 \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\tau_2}\right) \)      |

These results describe the typical time-dependent behavior of a Voigt-Kelvin-like model with two parallel Maxwell elements under constant stress (creep) and constant strain (relaxation).

# Solver

Let's break down the plan step by step:

**Plan:**
1. Write the constitutive equation for the parallel Maxwell model (two Maxwell elements in parallel).
2. Solve for the strain response to constant stress (creep test).
3. Solve for the stress response to constant strain (stress relaxation test).

---

**Step 1: Constitutive equation for the parallel Maxwell model**

Each Maxwell element (spring E_i and dashpot Î·_i in series) obeys:
\[
\sigma_i + \tau_i \frac{d\sigma_i}{dt} = E_i \tau_i \frac{d\varepsilon}{dt}\ , \qquad \tau_i = \frac{\eta_i}{E_i}
\]

The total stress is the sum of the stresses from both branches:
\[
\sigma(t) = \sigma_1(t) + \sigma_2(t)
\]

---

Now, let's proceed to Step 2: Solve for the strain response to constant stress (creep test).

The code step did not run due to a missing library, but let's proceed analytically:

For each Maxwell branch under constant stress \( \sigma_0 \):
\[
\sigma_0 = E_i \varepsilon_i + \eta_i \frac{d\varepsilon_i}{dt}
\]
This is a first-order linear ODE. The general solution is:
\[
\varepsilon_i(t) = \frac{\sigma_0}{E_i} \left(1 - e^{-\frac{E_i}{\eta_i} t}\right) + C_i e^{-\frac{E_i}{\eta_i} t}
\]
For initial condition \( \varepsilon_i(0) = 0 \) (assuming zero initial strain):
\[
C_i = 0
\]
So,
\[
\varepsilon_i(t) = \frac{\sigma_0}{E_i} \left(1 - e^{-t/\tau_i}\right),\quad \tau_i = \frac{\eta_i}{E_i}
\]
Total strain:
\[
\varepsilon(t) = \varepsilon_1(t) + \varepsilon_2(t) = \frac{\sigma_0}{E_1}\left(1 - e^{-t/\tau_1}\right) + \frac{\sigma_0}{E_2}\left(1 - e^{-t/\tau_2}\right)
\]

Now, let's proceed to Step 3: Stress response to constant strain (relaxation test).

Let's continue analytically:

For each Maxwell branch under constant strain \( \varepsilon_0 \):

\[
\sigma_i + \tau_i \frac{d\sigma_i}{dt} = 0
\]
where \( \tau_i = \frac{\eta_i}{E_i} \).

This is a simple ODE:
\[
\frac{d\sigma_i}{dt} = -\frac{\sigma_i}{\tau_i}
\]
with solution:
\[
\sigma_i(t) = \sigma_i(0) e^{-t/\tau_i}
\]
At \( t=0 \), for a step strain, the entire strain is taken by the spring, so \( \sigma_i(0) = E_i \varepsilon_0 \):
\[
\sigma_i(t) = E_i \varepsilon_0 e^{-t/\tau_i}
\]

Total stress:
\[
\sigma(t) = \sigma_1(t) + \sigma_2(t) = E_1 \varepsilon_0 e^{-t/\tau_1} + E_2 \varepsilon_0 e^{-t/\tau_2}
\]

---

## **Final Answers**

### Creep (Constant Stress \( \sigma_0 \)):
\[
\varepsilon(t) = \frac{\sigma_0}{E_1}\left(1 - e^{-t/\tau_1}\right) + \frac{\sigma_0}{E_2}\left(1 - e^{-t/\tau_2}\right)
\]

### Stress Relaxation (Constant Strain \( \varepsilon_0 \)):
\[
\sigma(t) = E_1 \varepsilon_0 e^{-t/\tau_1} + E_2 \varepsilon_0 e^{-t/\tau_2}
\]

Where \( \tau_i = \eta_i / E_i \).

**This completes the response for both loading scenarios of the given model.**

**Question restated for clarity:**

We have a viscoelastic model with two Maxwell elements in parallel (each Maxwell element = spring + dashpot in series). The parameters are:
- Branch 1: Spring modulus \(E_1\), dashpot viscosity \(\eta_1\)
- Branch 2: Spring modulus \(E_2\), dashpot viscosity \(\eta_2\)

We are to find the time-dependent response of this system under:
1. **Constant stress (creep test):** \(\sigma(t) = \sigma_0\) for \(t \ge 0\)
2. **Constant strain (stress relaxation test):** \(\varepsilon(t) = \varepsilon_0\) for \(t \ge 0\)

---

**Constitutive equations for each Maxwell branch:**

- For dashpot: \(\sigma_{dash} = \eta \frac{d\varepsilon}{dt}\)
- For spring: \(\sigma_{spring} = E \varepsilon\)

For each Maxwell branch under constant stress:
\[
\sigma_0 = E_i \varepsilon_i + \eta_i \frac{d\varepsilon_i}{dt}
\]

For each branch under constant strain:
\[
\sigma_i + \tau_i \frac{d\sigma_i}{dt} = 0, \quad \tau_i = \frac{\eta_i}{E_i}
\]

---

### 1. **Creep (Constant Stress \(\sigma_0\))**

For each branch, the strain is:
\[
\varepsilon_i(t) = \frac{\sigma_0}{E_i} \left(1 - e^{-t/\tau_i}\right)
\]
where \(\tau_i = \frac{\eta_i}{E_i}\).

Total strain:
\[
\varepsilon(t) = \frac{\sigma_0}{E_1}\left(1 - e^{-t/\tau_1}\right) + \frac{\sigma_0}{E_2}\left(1 - e^{-t/\tau_2}\right)
\]

---

### 2. **Stress Relaxation (Constant Strain \(\varepsilon_0\))**

For each branch, the stress is:
\[
\sigma_i(t) = E_i \varepsilon_0 e^{-t/\tau_i}
\]

Total stress:
\[
\sigma(t) = E_1 \varepsilon_0 e^{-t/\tau_1} + E_2 \varepsilon_0 e^{-t/\tau_2}
\]

where \(\tau_i = \frac{\eta_i}{E_i}\).

### **Evaluation of Solver's Answer**

#### **1. Content Comparison with Ground Truth**

**Ground Truth Key Points:**
- Model: Two Maxwell elements in parallel (each is a spring and dashpot in series).
- Initial conditions: \(\sigma(0)=\sigma_0\), \(\varepsilon(0)=\varepsilon_0\).
- Constitutive relations for dashpot and spring.
- **Constant Strain:** For \(\varepsilon = \text{constant}\), stress is simply \(\sigma = \varepsilon (E_1 + E_2)\).
- **Constant Stress:** 
  - Combined ODE: \(\sigma = (\eta_1 + \eta_2) \frac{d\varepsilon}{dt} + (E_1 + E_2)\varepsilon\)
  - Solution: Exponential approach to \(\varepsilon_\infty = \frac{\sigma}{E_1 + E_2}\).
  - Explicit solution: \(\varepsilon(t) = \frac{1}{E_1 + E_2}[\sigma - (\sigma - \varepsilon_0(E_1 + E_2)) e^{-\frac{(E_1 + E_2)t}{\eta_1 + \eta_2}}]\)

---

**Solver's Answer:**
- Correctly describes the constitutive equations for each Maxwell branch.
- Provides the solution for two parallel Maxwell models as the sum of two exponentials (as would be the case if the two Maxwell elements are truly in parallel and not combined into a single equivalent Maxwell).
- For **constant strain**, gives \(\sigma(t) = E_1 \varepsilon_0 e^{-t/\tau_1} + E_2 \varepsilon_0 e^{-t/\tau_2}\) (sum of two exponentials).
- For **constant stress**, gives \(\varepsilon(t) = \frac{\sigma_0}{E_1}\left(1 - e^{-t/\tau_1}\right) + \frac{\sigma_0}{E_2}\left(1 - e^{-t/\tau_2}\right)\) (sum of two exponentials).

---

#### **2. Accuracy and Model Interpretation**

- The **ground truth** treats the two Maxwell elements as if their parameters are simply summed, yielding a single ODE with effective parameters \((E_1 + E_2)\) and \((\eta_1 + \eta_2)\), which is correct if the two elements are identical or are mathematically combined.
- The **solver** treats them as two independent Maxwell elements in parallel and sums their individual responses, which is the standard approach for two parallel Maxwell elements *if we are not required to sum their parameters*.

#### **3. Completeness**

- The solver provides full ODE setup and solution for the parallel Maxwell model.
- The ground truth gives the effective single ODE and its solution.
- The solver's answer is **complete** for the standard physical interpretation of the two Maxwell elements in parallel, but did not mention the special case where the effective parameters are summed.

#### **4. Clarity and Methodology**

- The solver's answer is clear, with step-by-step derivation.
- The ground truth gives a more compact, "lumped parameter" result.

---

### **Scoring Details**

- **Correct physics/model:** 40/40
- **Correct solution form:** 30/30 (for standard parallel Maxwell model)
- **Match to ground truth's "lumped" model:** 10/20 (solver did not reduce to the single exponential case with summed parameters)
- **Clarity and step-by-step reasoning:** 10/10

---

### **Final Score**

**Score: 90/100**

#### **Comments:**
- The solver gives the correct and standard answer for two parallel Maxwell models, but the ground truth expected the answer in the form of a single exponential using summed parameters. 
- For full marks, the solver should have noted both approaches and clarified under what assumptions the two forms are equivalent.

---

**Recommendation:**  
Add a note that if the two Maxwell elements have the same relaxation time and modulus, the response reduces to a single exponential with summed coefficients, matching the ground truth. Otherwise, the sum of two exponentials is the general solution for two distinct Maxwell elements in parallel.
