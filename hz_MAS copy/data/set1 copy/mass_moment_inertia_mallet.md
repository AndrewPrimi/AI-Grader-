**Restated Question for Solver Agent:**

Given a wooden mallet consisting of two parts:
1. The head (a solid cylinder): length = 0.2 m, diameter = 0.07 m
2. The handle (a solid cylinder): length = 0.7 m, diameter = 0.03 m

You are to calculate:
- The moment of inertia (I) of the mallet about an axis perpendicular to the handle and passing through the end of the handle (the point you would hold).
- The radius of gyration (k) about this axis.

You must use the geometry of the mallet and the parallel axis theorem to find the total moment of inertia. Assume uniform mass distribution and that the densities of the head and handle are the same (unless specified otherwise).

**Hints/Formulas:**
- For a solid cylinder of mass M, length L, and radius R, the moment of inertia about its center perpendicular to its axis is \( I_{cyl,center} = \frac{1}{12} M L^2 + \frac{1}{4} M R^2 \).
- The parallel axis theorem: \( I = I_{cm} + M d^2 \), where d is the distance between the center of mass and the new axis.
- The radius of gyration: \( k = \sqrt{I/M_{total}} \)

**Required:**
1. Find the mass of each part (if needed, use density \( \rho \)), or keep answers in terms of mass.
2. Find the moment of inertia of each part about the axis at the end of the handle using the parallel axis theorem.
3. Sum the moments to get total I.
4. Find the radius of gyration.

If needed, you may use the following symbols:
- M₁, M₂: masses of head and handle
- L₁, L₂: lengths of head and handle
- R₁, R₂: radii of head and handle
- d₁, d₂: distances from each part's center of mass to the axis at the end of the handle

Proceed to solve.

# Solver

**Step-by-step Plan:**

1. Assign symbols and values for all given dimensions for both head and handle.
2. Express the mass of each part in terms of density (if not given).
3. Calculate the moment of inertia of the handle about the axis at the end of the handle (using parallel axis theorem if necessary).
4. Calculate the moment of inertia of the head about the same axis (using parallel axis theorem).
5. Add the moments of inertia from both parts to get the total moment of inertia.
6. Calculate the total mass and the radius of gyration.

Let's start with Step 1:

**Step 1: Assign symbols and values for all given dimensions**
- Head (part 1):
  - Length (L₁) = 0.2 m
  - Diameter (D₁) = 0.07 m → Radius (R₁) = 0.035 m
- Handle (part 2):
  - Length (L₂) = 0.7 m
  - Diameter (D₂) = 0.03 m → Radius (R₂) = 0.015 m

Proceeding to Step 2 next.

**Summary (using actual masses):**
- Masses:
  - \( M_1 = \rho \times V_1 \), \( M_2 = \rho \times V_2 \)
- Moment of inertia (about the end of the handle):
  \[
  I_{total} = \left[\frac{1}{12} M_2 L_2^2 + \frac{1}{4} M_2 R_2^2 + M_2 \left(\frac{L_2}{2}\right)^2\right] + \left[\frac{1}{12} M_1 L_1^2 + \frac{1}{4} M_1 R_1^2 + M_1 (L_2 + L_1/2)^2\right]

- Radius of gyration:
  \[
  k = \sqrt{I_{total} / (M_1 + M_2)}

**Restated Question for Solver Agent:**

Given a wooden mallet consisting of two parts:
1. The head (a solid cylinder): length = 0.2 m, diameter = 0.07 m
2. The handle (a solid cylinder): length = 0.7 m, diameter = 0.03 m

You are to calculate:
- The moment of inertia (I) of the mallet about an axis perpendicular to the handle and passing through the end of the handle (the point you would hold).
- The radius of gyration (k) about this axis.

You must use the geometry of the mallet and the parallel axis theorem to find the total moment of inertia. Assume uniform mass distribution and that the densities of the head and handle are the same (unless specified otherwise).

**Hints/Formulas:**
- For a solid cylinder of mass M, length L, and radius R, the moment of inertia about its center perpendicular to its axis is \( I_{cyl,center} = \frac{1}{12} M L^2 + \frac{1}{4} M R^2 \).
- The parallel axis theorem: \( I = I_{cm} + M d^2 \), where d is the distance between the center of mass and the new axis.
- The radius of gyration: \( k = \sqrt{I/M_{total}} \)

**Required:**
1. Find the mass of each part (if needed, use density \( \rho \)), or keep answers in terms of mass.
2. Find the moment of inertia of each part about the axis at the end of the handle using the parallel axis theorem.
3. Sum the moments to get total I.
4. Find the radius of gyration.

If needed, you may use the following symbols:
- M₁, M₂: masses of head and handle
- L₁, L₂: lengths of head and handle
- R₁, R₂: radii of head and handle
- d₁, d₂: distances from each part's center of mass to the axis at the end of the handle

Proceed to solve.

# Solver

**Final Results:**

**Moment of Inertia (about the end of the handle):**
\[
I_{total} = I_{end,handle} + I_{end,head} = 0.807\ M\cdot m^2\quad\text{(for unit masses)}
\]

**Radius of Gyration:**
\[
k = \sqrt{\frac{I_{total}}{M_{total}}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.807}{2}} \approx 0.635\ \text{m}\quad\text{(for unit masses)}
\]

**General Formulas:**
- Masses:
  - \(M_1 = \rho V_1\), \(M_2 = \rho V_2\)
- Moment of inertia (about end of handle):
  \[
  I_{total} = \left[\frac{1}{12} M_2 L_2^2 + \frac{1}{4} M_2 R_2^2 + M_2 \left(\frac{L_2}{2}\right)^2\right] + \left[\frac{1}{12} M_1 L_1^2 + \frac{1}{4} M_1 R_1^2 + M_1 (L_2 + L_1/2)^2\right]
  \]
- Radius of gyration:
  \[
  k = \sqrt{I_{total} / (M_1 + M_2)}
  \]

**Question Restatement:**

Given a wooden mallet with the following geometry:
- Head (solid cylinder): length 0.2 m, diameter 0.07 m (radius 0.035 m)
- Handle (solid cylinder): length 0.7 m, diameter 0.03 m (radius 0.015 m)

Calculate the total moment of inertia (I) of the mallet about an axis perpendicular to the handle and passing through the end of the handle (where it is held), using the parallel axis theorem. Also, calculate the radius of gyration (k) about this axis.

---

**Solution:**

1. **Masses (in terms of density \( \rho \))**
   - Volume of head: \( V_1 = \pi R_1^2 L_1 \)
   - Volume of handle: \( V_2 = \pi R_2^2 L_2 \)
   - Mass of head: \( M_1 = \rho V_1 \)
   - Mass of handle: \( M_2 = \rho V_2 \)

2. **Moment of inertia of each part about the axis at the end of the handle:**

   - **Handle:**
     - About its own center: \( I_{cm,2} = \frac{1}{12} M_2 L_2^2 + \frac{1}{4} M_2 R_2^2 \)
     - Distance from end to center: \( d_2 = L_2/2 \)
     - By parallel axis theorem: \( I_{end,2} = I_{cm,2} + M_2 (d_2)^2 = \frac{1}{3} M_2 L_2^2 + \frac{1}{4} M_2 R_2^2 \)

   - **Head:**
     - About its own center: \( I_{cm,1} = \frac{1}{12} M_1 L_1^2 + \frac{1}{4} M_1 R_1^2 \)
     - Distance from handle end to head center: \( d_1 = L_2 + L_1/2 \)
     - By parallel axis theorem: \( I_{end,1} = I_{cm,1} + M_1 d_1^2 \)

3. **Total moment of inertia:**
   \[
   I_{total} = I_{end,1} + I_{end,2}
   \]

4. **Radius of gyration:**
   \[
   k = \sqrt{\frac{I_{total}}{M_1 + M_2}}
   \]

---

**Numerical Example (for unit density):**
- \( V_1 \approx 0.0007697 \) m³, \( V_2 \approx 0.0004945 \) m³
- For unit masses: \( I_{end,2} \approx 0.1636 \) kg·m², \( I_{end,1} \approx 0.6434 \) kg·m²
- \( I_{total} = 0.807 \) kg·m²
- \( M_{total} = 2 \) kg
- \( k \approx 0.635 \) m

Substitute the density to get actual values for your mallet.
